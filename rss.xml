&lt;p&gt;Thanks for stopping by - my name is Seth Davis. I‚Äôm a Web Developer from Austin, Texas. I graduated from Texas State University with a Bachelors in Communication Design. For about 4 years, I worked as a Graphic Designer creating all sorts of things from Flash banner ads to e-commerce content. Slowly over time I picked up coding projects and eventually made the switch to Web Development. Now, I‚Äôm a UX Developer at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indeed.com/hire&quot;&gt;Indeed.com&lt;/a&gt; where I build features to help employers post better jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of work, I‚Äôm a husband and a father. I really enjoy reading and talking about electric vehicles. Occassionally you‚Äôll find me swimming in the greenbelt, playing soccer, exploring space (No Man‚Äôs Sky) or riding my bike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My plans for Tech with Seth are still in the works. For now, I plan on writing some posts and seeing where this whole blog thing takes me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That‚Äôs it for now. See ya!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
