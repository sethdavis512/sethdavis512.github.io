I graduated from Texas State University with a Bachelors in Communication Design. For about 4 years, I worked as a Graphic Designer creating all sorts of things from Flash banner ads to e-commerce content. Slowly over time I picked up coding projects and eventually made the switch to Web Development. Now, I’m a UX Developer at <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/hire\">Indeed.com</a> where I build features to help employers post better jobs.</p>\n<p>Outside of work, I’m a husband and a father. I really enjoy reading and talking about electric vehicles. Occassionally you’ll find me swimming in the greenbelt, playing soccer, exploring space (No Man’s Sky) or riding my bike.</p>\n<p>My plans for Tech with Seth are still in the works. For now, I plan on writing some posts and seeing where this whole blog thing takes me.</p>\n<p>That’s it for now. See ya!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Howdy y'all!","date":"October 07, 2019","description":"Welcome to my site"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/01-intro-post/","previous":null,"next":null}}}
