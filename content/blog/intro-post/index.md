Hello üëãüèª Welcome to Tech with Seth!

Thanks for stopping by - my name is Seth Davis. I'm a Web Developer from Austin, Texas. I graduated from Texas State University with a Bachelors in Communication Design. For about 4 years, I worked as a Graphic Designer creating all sorts of things from Flash banner ads to e-commerce content. Slowly over time I picked up coding projects and eventually made the switch to Web Development. Now, I'm a UX Developer at [Indeed.com](https://www.indeed.com/hire) where I build features to help employers post better jobs.

Outside of work, I'm a husband and a father. I really enjoy reading and talking about electric vehicles. Occassionally you'll find me swimming in the greenbelt, playing soccer, exploring space (No Man's Sky) or riding my bike.

My plans for Tech with Seth are still in the works. For now, I plan on writing some posts and seeing where this whole blog thing takes me.

That's it for now. See ya!
